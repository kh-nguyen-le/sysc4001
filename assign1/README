Source files are in ./src with the Makefile. To compile, cd into ./src and type make.

We used two 3rd party libraries to organize our data more efficiently and to simplify the non-IPC logic involved.
Specifically we used libevent's event scheduler to avoid having to sleep in the device periodic duties and GLib to for
Hash Table structure and efficient stringIO functions.

The entire contents of the ./include and ./lib folders to ensure that libevent is linked properly with needing root access.

To run to sys, first run the cloud with ./cloud then run the controller with ./controller [NAME]. The NAME parameter is not optional.

Then the devices must be configured in the following format:
 ./device -[TYPE] [THRESHOLD] [SYSTEM_NAME,COMPONENT_NAME,DEVICE_NAME]
 
 TYPE can be -s for sensor or -a for actuator
 THRESHOLD must be > 0 for sensor but may be omitted for acutuator
 A SYSTEM is a group of up to 5 components and may refer to an are or complex device, eg Bedroom or Television
 DEVICE_NAME should refer to what a sensor monitors or what an actuator moves, eg Sound or Motor
 
 The following are examples of valid device parameters.
 
 ./device -s 25 "Bedroom,Light,Heat"
 ./device -a "Bedroom,Light,Switch"
 ./device -s 50 "Bedroom,Door,Motion"
 ./device -a "Bedroom,Door,Lock"
